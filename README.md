## 🔥 Experience

This web application allowed me to discover React.js with the integration of an already existing website.
Due to this reproduction, I was able to confront real design and integration issues. I was able to overcome these difficulties with a deeper understanding of CSS. I was also able to enhance my responsive design skills.
